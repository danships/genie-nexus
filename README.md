Genie Nexus is a powerful API gateway that unifies access to AI language models and HTTP services. Built for technical teams who need reliability, control, and comprehensive analytics without vendor lock-in.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unified AI Access**: Single API endpoint for OpenAI, Google, and other AI providers
- **Smart Load Balancing**: Automatic failover and rate limit handling across providers
- **Enterprise Security**: Advanced API key management
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive usage tracking, cost monitoring, and performance insights
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API with enhanced reliability
- **Self-Hosted Control**: Deploy anywhere with full data ownership and customization

## Quick Start

Deploy with Docker in seconds:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/danships/genie-nexus:latest

_We advise to use a fixed version label instead of `latest`, check out [releases](https://github.com/danships/genie-nexus/releases) for details._

Access your unified API gateway at `http://localhost:3000`

## Bring Your Own API Keys

Genie Nexus requires you to provide your own API keys for AI providers (OpenAI, Google, etc.). We don't provide or manage API keys for you - this gives you full control over costs, usage, and data privacy. Simply configure your keys in the environment variables and Genie Nexus will handle the rest.
